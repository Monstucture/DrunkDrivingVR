# DrunkDrivingVR

A VR simulation that demonstrates the dangers of drunk driving, built for Meta Quest using Unity 6.

## Overview

DrunkDrivingVR places the player in a virtual environment where they can interact with an alcohol bottle and drive a car. Drinking from the bottle progressively impairs the player's vision and motor control, making driving increasingly difficult. The goal is to educate players on how alcohol affects driving ability.

## Features

- **VR Car Driving** — Accelerate, brake, and steer using Meta Quest controllers
- **Grabbable Alcohol Bottle** — Pick up and drop a bottle using the right-hand trigger
- **Drink Detection** — Raise the bottle to your face to drink; impairment builds with each sip
- **Drunk Effects** — Camera wobble and sway that intensify with alcohol consumption and fade over time
- **Car Enter/Exit** — Walk up to the car door handle and grab it to get in or out

## Controls

| Action | Input |
|---|---|
| Pick up / drop bottle | Right index trigger |
| Drink | Hold bottle near face for 1.5s |
| Enter / exit car | Grab door handle (grip or index trigger) |
| Accelerate | Right trigger (while in car) |
| Brake / reverse | Left trigger (while in car) |
| Steer | Left thumbstick (while in car) |
